# Cognitive Labs LLC — Company & Website Context

> For any AI agent working on this website. Read this before making copy, design, or structural changes.

## Company

**Cognitive Labs LLC** is an AI engineering and consulting firm based in Phoenix, AZ. Founded May 2025 by Alan Xiao. Currently pre-revenue.

**Core thesis:** Technical leverage for businesses past product-market fit. Clients bring domain expertise, revenue, and customers. Cognative Labs adds AI, automation, software, and execution speed.

**What we are:** The technical co-founder you never had.

**What we're not:** Not a generic dev shop. Not a startup studio building in unknown markets.

## Two-Lane Model

- **Lane 1 — Domains We Know:** Healthcare / Health IT (12 years Banner Health experience) and Logistics / Shipping (Annship). Both technical leverage and domain expertise.
- **Lane 2 — Domain Partner Model:** Client has the business and domain knowledge. We bring technical judgment, build capacity, and speed.

## Ideal Client

- Existing business with revenue ($500K-$10M typical), not a startup with an idea
- Clear operational bottleneck that software/AI can address
- Owner is sharp but not technical — knows what they need, can't build it
- Willing to pay for outcomes, not hours

## Service Offerings (Canonical Names)

These are the canonical service card names. Use these on service cards and in the contact form. Use shortened labels (Operations, Discovery, Custom Tools, AI Systems) in the footer only.

1. **Automate Your Operations** — workflow mapping, process automation, monitoring
2. **Figure Out Where to Start** — discovery sprint, use-case prioritization, build-vs-buy
3. **Build Custom Tools & Platforms** — internal tools, customer workflows, API integrations
4. **AI That Actually Works** — RAG, copilots, decision-support, guardrails, data pipelines

## Offer Packaging

- **Discovery Sprint ($2K-$5K):** scope, architecture, roadmap, and implementation plan
- **Pilot Build ($5K-$25K):** focused workflow automation or internal tool with measurable business outcome
- **Production Engagement ($25K+):** multi-workflow platform, integrations, and launch support

## Pricing Philosophy

We prefer outcomes-aligned pricing when results are measurable. For the right workflows, pricing can be tied to business impact, not just project scope. Discovery sprints use fixed-fee; AI agent deployments and automations are candidates for outcome-based models.

## Delivery Model

- **Discovery:** 1 week — workflow mapping, constraints, solution path
- **Fast-Track:** 3-7 days — tightly scoped, low-dependency implementations
- **Standard:** 4-8 weeks — prototype to production handoff
- **Ownership:** Source code and custom deliverables transferred per service agreement

## Tech Stack

Claude, GPT-4o, Llama, Mistral, LangGraph, CrewAI, FHIR APIs, AWS/GCP/Azure, Kafka, Spark, OR-Tools, reinforcement learning, NIST AI RMF

## Security & Compliance

- No foundation models trained on client data
- SOC 2-aligned controls (encrypted storage, least-privilege access, incident response)
- HIPAA alignment for healthcare use cases
- Data governance with lineage tracking and retention policies
- AI risk management guided by NIST AI RMF

## Copy Rules

Apply these whenever writing or editing Cognative Labs website copy:

1. **Cap key phrases:** "established businesses" max 2 above the fold + 1 footer. "Tightly scoped" in process section only. "Schedule a call" in nav only — vary elsewhere.
2. **Vary CTA intent by location** (see CTA Strategy table above).
3. **Differentiate service labels by context:** Canonical names on service cards. Shorter labels in footer.
4. **Reduce "We..." starts:** Mix sentence subjects — outcome-first ("Manual handoffs drop when..."), client-first ("Your team gets..."), process-first ("A 2-week discovery sprint surfaces..."). Target <50% "We" sentence starts.
5. **No duplicate tag+title phrasing.** Section tags add context, not echo the heading.
6. **Prefer client-facing language over self-referential.** Lead with what the client gets, not what we do.
